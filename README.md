#### Objective
I have created a Google chrome extension that will display the timetable from pingala website and notify the user for class
#### How to use it?
To use the extension, just download the Pingala_Timetable.zip file in your computer. Then open Google Chrome and type "chrome://extensions" in the address bar.
Enable "Developer mode". Then drag and drop the extracted folder there to install it. Then navigate to the Add/Drop application Page and apply the extension. To load the timetable, click on "Load Timetable" button. To save it click on the save button. And click on the set notifications button to make it notify you 30 minutes before your class.
